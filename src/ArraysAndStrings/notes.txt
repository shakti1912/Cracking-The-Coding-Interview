This is the notes file for Arrays and Strings Chapter.

ASCII vs Unicode:
	ASCII : ascii is an acronym for "american standard code for information interchange".
	used for storing/displaying text,simple formatting and a few other control characters. 

	Unicode : ascii has been superseded by unicode, a double byte character system designed to store
	 and display a much wider range of letters.(65,536) the extra include foreign languages and
	 mathematical/scientific symbols, plus space for future expansion.
	all ascii characters still exist in unicode, either prefixed or suffixed by a null. 
	the difference being big-endian or little-endian respectfully.

Arrays.sort() vs Collections.sort()
	Arrays.sort works for arrays which can be of primitive data type also. This is Dual-Pivot Quicksort algorithm
	Collections.sort() works for objects Collections like ArrayList, LinkedList, etc. This is mergesort
	

String Manipulation problems: start from the end and work backwards
